Instructions on how to run:

1. Open MySQL and create a database called 'availitydb'.
2. Import the 'Availity' project folder into your Java IDE, then, open the 'application.properties' file (located in scr/main/resources) and change the fields 'spring.datasource.username=' and 'spring.datasource.password=
with the username and password that you use for your own SQL connection.
3. Right click on the class called SpringBootSecurityJwtApplication.java, and run it as a Java Application.
4. Import the 'frontend' project folder into Visual Studio Code. Then, right click on the 'frontend' folder, and select 'Open in Integrated Terminal'
5. Type 'npm install' and wait for all the modules to be installed.
6. Type 'npm start', the front end application should open now.

If the instructions above don't work, I would be happy to demonstrate the code myself from my computer.
